Tomato seeds were brought from Mexico to Spain by those early explorers. From there the plant spread to Italy by the mid-1500s where it began to be incorporated into regional cuisine.",

He settled in New York City in 1948 to train at the Art Students League of New York and fell in with artists like Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and Philip Guston. Famed gallerist Leo Castelli was a champion of his expressive, impastoed still lifes, portraits, and color field paintings. Many of Yektai’s works hover between abstraction and representation.",

While living in La Ruche, an artists’ residence in Paris, he made friends with the employees of slaughterhouses and often painted the cuts of meat he acquired from them. In 1925, when he moved to a larger studio, Soutine procured an entire steer carcass and hauled it back to the space. Over several weeks, he executed at least four similar canvases as well as sketches and smaller paintings; all the while the meat decomposed.The process of rendering this subject had intense psychological ramifications for Soutine. Soutine remarked,  “Once I saw a butcher cut the neck of a goose and drain the blood out of it. I wanted to cry out but his joyful expression made the cry stick in my throat. . . . This cry, I always feel it. . . . When I painted the beef carcass, it was still this cry that I wanted to liberate.”",
